Typechecking

to enable type checking in regular js 
// @ts-check at first line

this will lock in the types on the first assignment for the variable. You can also explicitly assign the type.

```
/** new document.js file */
// @ts-check

let x = 15;

x=21;
x='156'; // shows an error bc the variable was previously assigned a number

/** @type {number} */
let value;

value = 21;
value = '21'; //shows an error becuase the type was declared above
```

You can assign the type to be pretty much anything; object, array, function, specific element...

Here the type is an hmtl element
```
/** @type {Element} */
let x = document.querySelector('.passwordField');
```

Or you can be more specific
```
/** @type {HTMLInputElement} */
let x = document.querySelector('.passwordField');
// 🛑 Type 'Element' is not assignable to type 'HTMLInputElement'
// 🛑 Property 'accept' is missing in type 'Element'.
```

example of explicit type casting.
```
/** @type {HTMLInputElement} */
let x = /** @type {HTMLInputElement} */(
  document.querySelector('passwordField')
);
```
this will force the system to see the variable as the declared type. In the exampe above, x will now be accepted as an input element.
